# Building a Simple Internet Search App Using Anthropic Model Context Protocol

## Introduction

The Anthropic Model Context Protocol (AMCP) is an open standard protocol that enables developers to provide context to LLMs. It represents a significant advancement in how we interact with AI assistants. By connecting Claude with external tools and services, AMCP enhances Claude's capabilities beyond its built-in knowledge. Today, we'll explore how to create a simple yet powerful search application by connecting Claude's desktop app with Brave Search.
This integration allows Claude to perform real-time internet searches, providing you with current information beyond Claude's knowledge cutoff date. Whether you're researching a topic, fact-checking information, or simply exploring the web, this integration transforms Claude into an even more powerful assistant.
In this tutorial, we'll walk through every step of setting up this integration, from creating a Brave Search account to configuring Claude for seamless search capabilities.

## Understanding the Components

Before diving into the setup process, let's understand the key components involved:

**Claude Desktop App**: Claude is Anthropic's conversational AI assistant that can understand complex requests and generate thoughtful responses. The desktop version brings Claude's capabilities to your computer as a standalone application.

**Brave Search MCP Server**: Brave Search provides privacy-focused web search results. Their Model Context Protocol (MCP) server allows AI assistants like Claude to access their search capabilities through a standardized interface.

**Anthropic Model Context Protocol (AMCP)**: This protocol enables Claude to communicate with external services like Brave Search while maintaining context throughout the conversation. It creates a structured format for data exchange between Claude and third-party tools.

The magic happens when these components work together: you ask Claude a question, Claude recognizes when it needs current information, it queries Brave Search through AMCP, and then provides you with up-to-date answers.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the setup process, make sure you have:

1. **Claude Desktop App**: Download and install the latest version from Anthropic's official website. The app is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

2. **Brave Search Account**: You'll need a free account to access their API. 

## Setting Up Brave Search API

Let's start by obtaining your Brave Search API key:

1. **Create a Brave Search Account**:
   - Navigate to https://api-dashboard.search.brave.com/
   - Click on "Sign Up" if you're new, or "Log In" if you already have an account
   - Complete the registration process with your email and password
   - Verify your email address through the link sent to your inbox

2. **Obtain Your API Key**:
   - After logging in, go to https://api-dashboard.search.brave.com/app/keys
   - Click on "Create New API Key"
   - Name your key (e.g., "Claude Integration")
   - Select the appropriate services (Web Search is what we need for this tutorial)
   - Copy your new API key and store it securelyâ€”you'll need it when configuring Claude

3. **Understand Usage Limits**:
   - Free tier accounts typically have daily or monthly query limits
   - Take note of these limits to avoid unexpected service interruptions
   - Consider upgrading to a paid plan if you anticipate heavy usage

The API key serves as your authentication token when Claude makes requests to Brave Search on your behalf. Never share this key publicly, as others could use it and consume your search quota.

## Configuring Claude Desktop App for AMCP

Now that you have your Brave Search API key, let's configure Claude to use it. We'll cover two methods: the user interface approach and manual JSON configuration.

### Method 1: Using the Claude Desktop App UI (Recommended for Beginners)

1. Open the Claude desktop app
2. Click on the gear icon in the lower-left corner to access Settings
3. Navigate to the "Developer" tab
4. Look for the "Model Context Protocol" or "MCP" section
5. Click "Add Service" and fill in the following details:
   - Service Name: "Brave Search"
   - Service Type: "Web Search"
   - API Endpoint: "https://api.search.brave.com/mcp/v1/web"
   - Authentication Type: "Bearer Token"
   - Token: [Paste your API key here]
6. Configure additional parameters:
   - Results Count: 5 (adjust as needed)
   - Safe Search: Moderate (options: off, moderate, strict)
7. Click "Test Connection" to verify everything works
8. Save your configuration

### Method 2: Manual Configuration via JSON File (Advanced Method)

For more technical users who prefer direct configuration:

1. Close the Claude desktop app if it's running
2. Navigate to the configuration directory:
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\`
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/`
   - Linux: `~/.config/Claude/`
3. Create or edit a file named `claude_desktop_config.json`
4. Add the following JSON structure (replace YOUR_API_KEY_HERE with your actual API key):

```json
{
  "mcp_services": {
    "brave_search": {
      "name": "Brave Search",
      "endpoint": "https://api.search.brave.com/mcp/v1/web",
      "auth": {
        "type": "bearer",
        "token": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
      },
      "parameters": {
        "count": 5,
        "safe_search": "moderate"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

5. Save the file and restart the Claude desktop app

### Comparison of Methods

The UI method is more user-friendly and provides immediate feedback, making it ideal for beginners. The JSON method offers more precise control and can be easily backed up or version-controlled. Choose the approach that best fits your comfort level with technical configuration.

## Testing Your Integration

Now that you've set up the integration, it's time to test it! Here are some effective ways to verify everything is working correctly:
